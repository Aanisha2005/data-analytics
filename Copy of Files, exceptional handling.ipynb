Here are the key reasons why multithreading is used:\n","\n","### **1. Improved Performance in CPU-Bound Tasks**:\n","   - **Parallelism**: When an application has multiple tasks that can run in parallel (such as computations), multithreading allows you to distribute those tasks across multiple CPU cores, speeding up processing time.\n","   - **Example**: In scientific computations or image processing, multithreading can process multiple pieces of data simultaneously.\n","\n","### **2. Better Responsiveness in I/O-Bound Applications**:\n","   - **Concurrency**: For applications that wait for I/O operations (like file reading, network communication, or database queries), multithreading allows the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the I/O operation to complete.\n","   - **Example**: A web server can handle multiple user requests at once by using separate threads for each request, improving responsiveness.\n","\n","### **3. Efficient Use of Multi-Core Processors**:\n","   - **Optimized Resource Utilization**: Multithreading takes full advantage of multi-core processors, where each core can run a separate thread, making better use of available resources.\n","   - **Example**: Modern servers often have many cores, and multithreading ensures that each core is used efficiently, speeding up processes like handling multiple user requests.\n","\n","### **4. Improved User Experience**:\n","   - **Non-Blocking UI**: In graphical applications, multithreading can be used to keep the user interface responsive while performing background tasks (e.g., file downloads, data processing). This prevents the application from freezing or becoming unresponsive.\n","   - **Example**: A music player app can continue playing music while the user browses their library or updates the playlist in the background.\n","\n","### **5. Simplifying Complex Problems**:\n","   - **Task Separation**: Multithreading can simplify the design of certain applications by breaking them into smaller, independent tasks that can run concurrently.\n","   - **Example**: In a data analysis pipeline, tasks like data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) can be done in parallel to speed up the process.\n","\n","### **Conclusion**:\n","Multithreading is essential for improving performance in CPU-bound and I/O-bound applications, making better use of system resources, improving user experience, and simplifying complex problems. By running multiple tasks simultaneously, multithreading helps applications work faster and more efficiently."],"metadata":{"id":"KpMyczDl8RJN"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**PRACTICAL QUESTIONS**"],"metadata":{"id":"bfWJ1NMiNiNW"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Q1:How can you open a file for writing in Python and write a string to it?\n","# Open a file for writing (creates the file if it doesn't exist)\n","with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:\n","    # Write a string to the file\n","    file.write('Hello, this is a string written to the file!')\n"],"metadata":{"id":"JHxVKZ1xN0if"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Q2:Write a Python program to read the contents of a file and print each line.\n","# Open the file in read mode\n","with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n","    # Read each line in the file\n","    for line in file:\n","        print(line.strip())  # strip() is used to remove any extra newlines at the end of each line\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"SsrmZRPNOcog","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738492592082,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":507,"user":{"displayName":"Aanisha GN","userId":"17686288113042909782"}},"outputId":"19f7176d-702a-42ed-e3e9-393d08e85746"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello, this is a string written to the file!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Q3:How would you handle a case where the file doesn't exist while trying to open it for reading?\n","try:\n","    # Try to open the file in read mode\n","    with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n","        # Read each line in the file\n","        for line in file:\n","            print(line.strip())\n","except FileNotFoundError:\n","    # Handle the case when the file does not exist\n","    print(\"The file 'example.txt' does not exist.\")\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"EGfauGmmO86u","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738492655105,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":473,"user":{"displayName":"Aanisha GN","userId":"17686288113042909782"}},"outputId":"30f49124-789e-4626-f696-452a483b814b"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello, this is a string written to the file!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#4:Write a Python script that reads from one file and writes its content to another file.\n","# Open the source file in read mode and the destination file in write mode\n","with open('example.txt', 'r') as example_file:\n","    content = example_file.read()  # Read the entire content of the example file\n","\n","with open('destination.txt', 'w') as destination_file:\n","    destination_file.write(content)  # Write the content to the destination file\n","\n","print(\"Content has been copied from 'example.txt' to 'destination.txt'.\")\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"-0JZFW_0PRY1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738493395030,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":480,"user":{"displayName":"Aanisha GN","userId":"17686288113042909782"}},"outputId":"3e900fd1-fdde-4bcb-921b-cab82ca79bad"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Content has been copied from 'example.txt' to 'destination.txt'.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Q5:How would you catch and handle division by zero error in Python?\n","try:\n","    # Attempt to divide\n","    numerator = 10\n","    denominator = 0\n","    result = numerator / denominator\n","    print(\"The result is:\", result)\n","except ZeroDivisionError:\n","    # Handle the division by zero error\n","    print(\"Error: Cannot divide by zero!\")\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"aPFLyjUwSBZb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738493488761,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":524,"user":{"displayName":"Aanisha GN","userId":"17686288113042909782"}},"outputId":"e16127ce-26c1-410c-b9b4-495d5bbd01da"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Error: Cannot divide by zero!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Q6:Write a Python program that logs an error message to a log file when a division by zero exception occurs.\n","import logging\n","\n","# Configure logging to write to a file\n","logging.basicConfig(filename='error_log.txt', level=logging.ERROR)\n","\n","try:\n","    # Attempt to divide\n","    numerator = 10\n","    denominator = 0\n","    result = numerator / denominator\n","    print(\"The result is:\", result)\n","except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n","    # Log the error message to the log file\n","    logging.error(f\"Error: Division by zero occurred.
