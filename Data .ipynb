Think of it as having labels (keys) to quickly find the information (values) you need.\n","\n","### How it works:\n","1. **Keys** are like labels or titles, and they must be unique (no duplicates). For example, in a dictionary of student scores, the student’s name could be the key.\n","2. **Values** are the actual data associated with the keys.

If you have a list with repeated values but only need each one once, a set is perfect.  \n","   Example:  \n","   ```python\n","   my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]\n","   my_set = set(my_list)  # {1, 2, 3, 4}\n","   ```\n","\n","2. **Faster Lookups**:  \n","   Sets are optimized for checking if an item exists.
