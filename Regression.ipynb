Applications include modeling growth, forecasting trends, predicting behavior in economics, engineering, and biological processes. For example, in real estate, price may increase rapidly with size up to a point, then plateau, which a polynomial model can capture.

These models are also highly sensitive to outliers, which can disproportionately influence the curve. Another limitation is extrapolation unreliability; predictions outside the observed range may become wildly inaccurate. Polynomial models can also become computationally expensive with multiple variables and high degrees, leading to a large number of features.
